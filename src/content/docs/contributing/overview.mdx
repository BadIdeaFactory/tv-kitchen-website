## Contribution Types
### 1. TV Kitchen Improvements

If you want to improve TV Kitchen's underlying tooling, please visit these repositories:

* [tvkitchen/countertop](https://github.com/tvkitchen/countertop): The code responsible for managing data flow between appliances.

* [tvkitchen/base](https://github.com/tvkitchen/base): Interface-level abstract definitions, DTOs, type definitions for use across the TV Kitchen. 

### 2. Creating Appliances

If you want to contribute a new way to extract data from video, you will probably want to [create a new appliance](/docs/building-appliances).  Please visit this repository for inspiration:

* [tvkitchen/appliances](https://github.com/tvkitchen/appliances): This monorepo houses community supported TV Kitchen Appliances.

**Note:** Anybody can create a new appliance without having to release it through our repository.  Appliances are just packages that conform to [the Appliance API](https://github.com/tvkitchen/base/blob/master/packages/interfaces/src/IAppliance.js).
