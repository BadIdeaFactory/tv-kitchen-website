Media-Data Research Consortium (M-DRC), which is working to make TV news (and other media) accessible for computational analysis by scholars, journalists and others.  The Consortium partners with the Internet Archive’s [TV News Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv) to enhance public benefit access to its ongoing collections of broadcast and cable TV news.
