TV Kitchen welcomes partners who will use TV Kitchen ethically to conduct investigations and analysis that provide information, research, and service journalism for the public and will enable people to make informed decisions. This is an evolving field, and we encourage TV Kitchen partners to help Bad Idea factory in developing and continually reevaluating ethical guidelines in media analysis. At a minimum, we expect TV Kitchen experiments to:
- Be rigorous and fact-based, following best practices in data analysis and visualization;
- adhere to highest ethical standards with analyses that may impact gender equity or vulnerable communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, rural populations, and LGBTQ communities;
- respect the privacy of private citizens;
- hold power accountable in service of an informed public.
