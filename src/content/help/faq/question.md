Potential uses of TV Kitchen are limited, as the saying goes, only by your imagination–if your imagination runs toward doing interesting things with information you get out of video. 

For starters, we’ve built a simple recipe that when you deploy it pulls and collects closed captioning from TV streams. This means most news shows. So you could potentially:

* Analyze common terms used by your local news programs, and compare them across networks to see how they differ;

* Create an alert system to let you know when your favorite topic is being discussed on TV;

* Pipe your favorite caption stream into some kind of [real time annotation interface](https://github.com/The-Politico/gspan)

As more appliances are created and contributed, and participants share metadata they collect, all kinds of uses will become possible – certainly ones we can’t think of by ourselves.
