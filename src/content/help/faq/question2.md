question: Why is community important for TV Kitchen?
score: 9
---

TV Kitchen is built on the philosophy that the more people who get involved – developers, reporters, researchers – the more creative the recipes will become, and the richer the ingredients.

Rather than sinking all development costs and ownership in one organization that creates a bespoke architecture and is is then responsible for creating every iteration of every use, participants benefit from open source resources
  
We hope that participants will also join in lively conversation via the Slack community and in other ways, because the more we communicate, the better the ideas.
