Yes! Local television news still attracts [25 million nightly viewers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/local-news-and-national-politics/C8EEA488A777C37C7987964F8F85AEB5), and [remains the most trusted source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/260492/trust-internet-news-accuracy-points.aspx) for news. Major media conglomerates, including Sinclair, Tegna, and Nexstar, have been snapping up these local stations, and [now control](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/11/buying-spree-brings-more-local-tv-stations-to-fewer-big-companies/) nearly 40 percent. And despite the rise in social media advertising, local TV [still attracted more than $1 billion](https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/local-tv-news/) in political advertising during the 2018 elections.
