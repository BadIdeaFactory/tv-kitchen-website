## Why TV Kitchen?

Local television news still attracts some [20 million nightly viewers](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/07/State-of-the-News-Media_2017-Archive.pdf#page=30), and [remains the most trusted source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/260492/trust-internet-news-accuracy-points.aspx) for news. Major media conglomerates, including Sinclair, Tegna, and Nexstar, have been snapping up these local stations, and [now control](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/11/buying-spree-brings-more-local-tv-stations-to-fewer-big-companies/) nearly 40 percent. And despite the rise in social media advertising, six publicly held local TV station companies [collected $1.2 billion](https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/local-tv-news/) for political advertising during the 2018 elections.
But for researchers and journalists, local TV remains opaque. If you want to analyze local coverage of recent protests for racial justice, the pandemic, or the election, you need to pay an expensive private firm or ignore this major source of information.

## How we got here

In 2016, the TV Kitchen team worked with the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) on the [Political TV Ad Archive](https://politicaladarchive.org/), tracking political ads on TV and turning them into data. This fueled all kinds of creative uses, including an online [video game](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/super-campaign-dodger/462531/), a visual on how CNN, Fox, and MSNBC [covered presidential debates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/29/us/elections/debate-moments.html), and [fact-checks](https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/PolAd_DonaldTrump_5rk9i) of political ads. TV Kitchen takes this same functionality and invites the public to collaborate.
